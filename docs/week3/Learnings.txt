# Week 3: Network & SSH - What I Learned

## Technical Skills Acquired

### Networking Fundamentals
- **IP Addressing:** Understood how devices communicate within local networks and connect to the internet through NAT (Network Address Translation)
- **DNS Resolution Process:** Learned the complete hierarchy from OS cache → DNS resolver → root servers → TLD servers → authoritative servers
- **TCP vs UDP:** Grasped when to use reliable connections (TCP) vs fast, connectionless protocols (UDP)
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Understood web communication protocols and how to inspect them with curl

### Network Troubleshooting Commands
- `ping` - Test basic connectivity and measure response times
- `traceroute` - Visualize network path and identify routing issues
- `nslookup` / `dig` - Diagnose DNS resolution problems
- `curl` - Test web server responses and inspect HTTP headers
- `netstat` / `ss` - Monitor active connections and listening ports

### SSH Mastery
- **SSH Keys:** Understand public/private key authentication (more secure than passwords)
- **ssh-agent:** Learned to manage key passphrases for convenience without sacrificing security
- **scp:** Transfer files securely between machines
- **SSH Hardening:** Disable password auth, change ports, restrict users
- **SSH Config:** Create shortcuts for frequently accessed hosts

## Problem-Solving Insights

### The "60% Understanding" Philosophy
I realized I don't need to know EVERY detail of networking protocols to be job-ready. Understanding:
- WHAT each protocol does
- WHY we use it
- HOW to troubleshoot with it
- ONE practical scenario

This is sufficient for cloud engineering work. Deep details can be learned on the job when needed.

### Practical vs Academic Learning
**Initial approach:** Trying to understand packet headers, TCP state machines, DNS zone transfers in detail

**Corrected approach:** Focus on practical usage and troubleshooting. I can explain how DNS works conceptually and use dig/nslookup effectively - that's what matters for the job.

**Key insight:** Employers want someone who can USE tools to solve problems, not someone who can lecture on protocol internals.

### Script Development Process
Building the network toolkit taught me:
1. Start simple (basic ping test)
2. Add features incrementally
3. Test each addition before moving forward
4. Organize code with functions (easier to maintain)
5. Think about user experience (clean output, error handling)

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Port 443 Not Showing as LISTEN
**Problem:** When browsing websites, expected to see port 443 LISTEN on my machine, but it didn't appear.

**Solution:** Realized LISTEN ports only show for services I'm HOSTING. When browsing, I'm the CLIENT connecting TO servers' LISTEN ports. My machine uses random high ports (50000+) for outbound connections.

**Lesson:** Understanding client vs server roles in networking.

### Challenge 2: SSH Passphrase Prompts
**Problem:** Windows SSH worked without prompts, but Ubuntu kept asking for key passphrase.

**Solution:** Learned about ssh-agent - it caches unlocked keys for the session. Added ssh-agent initialization to ~/.bashrc so I only enter passphrase once per session.

**Lesson:** Security vs convenience balance - ssh-agent provides both.

### Challenge 3: Script Output Management
**Problem:** Network diagnostic script printed everything to terminal AND file, cluttering the screen.

**Solution:** Wrapped all output in `{ }` block and redirected entire block to file:
```bash
{
  # All functions and output here
} > "$REPORT"

echo "Results saved to $REPORT"  # Only this shows on terminal
```

**Lesson:** Advanced I/O redirection for professional user experience. This wasn't in the requirements but made the tool more usable.

### Challenge 4: Handling Unresponsive Hosts
**Problem:** Script would hang indefinitely if a host was down or firewall blocked traffic.

**Solution:** Added timeout limits to all network commands:
- `timeout 5 ping ...`
- `timeout 5 dig ...`
- `curl --max-time 5 ...`

**Lesson:** Production scripts must handle failures gracefully. Timeouts prevent infinite hangs.

## Skills That Clicked

### Understanding Network Flows
The "google.com connection" example made everything clear:
1. Browser asks OS for google.com's IP
2. OS checks DNS cache, if not found asks DNS resolver
3. DNS hierarchy resolves domain to IP
4. TCP connection established (three-way handshake)
5. HTTP request sent over TCP
6. Response received, connection closed

**This end-to-end understanding helps troubleshoot where things break.**

### Listening Ports Concept
Finally understood what "LISTEN" means:
- **Server side:** Port is LISTEN (waiting for connections)
- **Client side:** Uses random high port to connect TO server's LISTEN port

**This distinction is crucial for firewall rules and security.**

### SSH as Daily Tool
SSH isn't just "remote access" - it's THE way cloud engineers work:
- Connect to servers (no GUI on production servers)
- Deploy code (scp for file transfers)
- Automate tasks (SSH in scripts)
- Secure by default (encrypted communication)

**Understanding I'll use SSH literally EVERY DAY in cloud work.**

## Code Quality Improvements

### What I Did Well
- ✅ Organized code with functions (modular, reusable)
- ✅ Used meaningful variable names (PING_OK, DNS_OK)
- ✅ Added color coding for visual feedback
- ✅ Implemented error handling (command existence checks)
- ✅ Timeout handling for network commands
- ✅ Multi-host support (scales beyond single target)

### What I Learned About Bash
- Boolean flags for tracking state
- Command existence checks (`command -v`)
- Proper conditional syntax (`[ "$VAR" = true ]`)
- Looping through arguments (`for HOST in "$@"`)
- Capturing command output (`VAR=$(command)`)
- I/O redirection blocks (`{ } > file`)

## Connection to Cloud Engineering

### Why These Skills Matter

**Troubleshooting AWS EC2:**
```bash
# Instance not accessible?
ping ec2-instance-ip          # Is it reachable?
ssh -i key.pem user@ec2-ip    # Can I connect?
curl -I http://ec2-ip         # Is web server running?
netstat -tuln | grep :80      # Is port 80 listening?
```

**DNS Issues in Cloud:**
```bash
# Website not loading?
dig mywebsite.com             # Does DNS resolve?
nslookup mywebsite.com @8.8.8.8  # Try different DNS
```

**Security Groups (AWS Firewalls):**
Understanding ports and LISTEN states helps configure:
- Which ports to open (22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP)
- Which IPs to allow (0.0.0.0/0 vs specific IPs)
- TCP vs UDP rules

**Every networking concept this week directly applies to AWS VPC, Security Groups, and EC2 troubleshooting.**

## What I'd Do Differently Next Time

### Time Management
**What happened:** Spent 3 days on IP addressing, DNS, and ports concepts.

**Better approach:** Would time-box concept learning to 1 day per topic, focus more on hands-on practice. Understanding flows at 60-70% depth is sufficient - can always go deeper when needed.

### Commands Practice
**What happened:** Learned all commands individually, then used in project.

**Better approach:** Would create small "mini-challenges" while learning each command:
- "Find which service is using port 3306"
- "Trace route to 3 different websites, compare paths"
- "Use curl to check if GitHub is down"

**More practice = deeper retention.**

### Documentation While Learning
**What happened:** Took mental notes, documented at end.

**Better approach:** Would keep running notes of "aha moments" and interesting discoveries. Easier to write LEARNINGS.md when insights are fresh.

## Mistakes & Lessons

### Mistake 1: Overthinking TCP/UDP
Initially wanted to understand TCP three-way handshake in packet-level detail, sliding windows, congestion control.

**Lesson:** This is network engineering level detail. For cloud engineering, knowing "TCP = reliable, UDP = fast" and when to use each is sufficient. Can learn deep details if job requires it.

### Mistake 2: Trying to Disable All SSH Auth
Tried setting both `PasswordAuthentication no` and `PubkeyAuthentication no` thinking it would stop prompts.

**Lesson:** The prompt was from my encrypted KEY, not SSH config. Learned about ssh-agent as the proper solution. Always understand what you're configuring before changing it.

### Mistake 3: Not Testing Edge Cases Initially
First script version didn't handle:
- Unresponsive hosts (infinite hang)
- Missing tools (crash if traceroute not installed)
- Multiple hosts (only checked one at a time)

**Lesson:** Think about failure modes WHILE coding, not after. "What if this fails?" should be asked for every command.

## Confidence Gained

### Before Week 3:
- Knew networking existed but felt abstract
- SSH seemed intimidating
- Unsure how to troubleshoot connectivity issues
- Worried about "not knowing enough"

### After Week 3:
- Can explain network flows confidently
- Comfortable SSH'ing into machines
- **Have a mental checklist for diagnosing problems:**
  1. Can I ping? (Is host reachable?)
  2. Does DNS work? (Is name resolving?)
  3. Is service running? (Is port listening?)
  4. Can I connect? (Firewall blocking?)
- Understand that 60-70% depth is JOB-READY

**Most importantly:** Built confidence that I can FIGURE THINGS OUT. When I don't understand something, I know how to explore, test, and learn it.
